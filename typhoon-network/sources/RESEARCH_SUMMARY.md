## Critical Data Gaps

### High Priority Gaps

1. **Website URL** (Tier 1)
   - **Impact**: Cannot verify official information
   - **Attempted**: 4 common domain patterns
   - **Next Steps**:
     - Check GitHub repository README for official links
     - Search crypto forums for announcements
     - Review social media for official accounts

2. **Project Description** (Tier 1)
   - **Impact**: Cannot explain what the project does
   - **Attempted**: GitHub org profile, Web3Privacy API
   - **Next Steps**:
     - Manual review of GitHub repository README files
     - Check repository documentation folders
     - Search for whitepaper or technical docs

3. **Smart Contract Addresses** (Tier 2)
   - **Impact**: Cannot verify on-chain activity
   - **Attempted**: Etherscan, GitHub code
   - **Next Steps**:
     - Review deployment scripts in repositories
     - Check GitHub issues/discussions for contract addresses
     - Search transaction patterns on explorers

4. **Team/Founders** (Tier 2)
   - **Impact**: Cannot verify project legitimacy
   - **Attempted**: GitHub contributors (rate limited), LinkedIn
   - **Next Steps**:
     - Wait for GitHub API rate limit reset
     - Search Twitter for team member profiles
     - Check conference/event speaker lists

### Medium Priority Gaps

5. **Social Media Links** (Tier 3)
