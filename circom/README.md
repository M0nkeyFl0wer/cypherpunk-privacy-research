## 📝 Description

Circom is a specialized compiler and circuit description language for building zero-knowledge proof applications. Written in Rust, it enables developers to design arithmetic circuits that are compiled to R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint System) format, allowing them to create, test, and generate zero-knowledge proofs. The ecosystem includes the circom compiler, supporting libraries like circomlib (containing hundreds of circuit templates for comparators, hash functions, digital signatures, and converters), circomlibjs, and snarkjs to facilitate the entire zero-knowledge proof development process. Circom enables the creation of large circuits by combining smaller generic circuits called templates, opening up possibilities for privacy-preserving applications in digital identities, voting systems, and financial transactions where proving statement validity without revealing underlying data is critical.
