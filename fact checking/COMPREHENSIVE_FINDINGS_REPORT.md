## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Delete or correct the 2 confirmed fabrications**
   - Patrick Weiler: Remove Bill C-55 vote claim
   - Clifford Small: Correct date range to 2021-2024

2. **Verify spouse names**
   - Patrick Weiler: Find actual spouse name (or confirm unmarried)
   - Check all other family claims

3. **Verify staff directory**
   - Cross-reference all staff names against official directories
   - Update phone numbers/positions

4. **Verify remaining voting records**
   - Check 2022-2023 votes against OpenParliament
   - Verify specific bill numbers and dates

### Long-term Work
1. **Process remaining people** (150+ people beyond committee members)
   - Influencers/Allies sections
   - Lobbyists
   - First Nations leaders
   - Donors (mark as Elections Canada records per user)

2. **Generate marked-up document**
   - Apply color coding (green/yellow/red)
   - Add clickable source links
   - Include explanatory notes for fabrications

3. **Create final verification database**
   - Reusable for future fact-checking
   - Documented methodology
