# 🐕 Spec Kit Assistant - Startup Context

**READ THIS FIRST AND ACT ON IT IMMEDIATELY!**

## Current Project State
- **Stage**: Project initialized, needs specification
- **Project**: web3-privacy-ethereum-cypherpunk-research

## Your Immediate Task
Project initialized. Create a specification first.

**Suggested command**: `/specify "feature description"`

## What To Do Now

Based on the stage above, take the appropriate action:

1. **No spec yet** → Ask "What would you like to build?" then run `/spec specify`
2. **Has spec, no plan** → Run `/spec plan` to create implementation plan
3. **Has plan, no tasks** → Run `/spec tasks` to generate tasks
4. **Has tasks** → Start implementing! Begin with task 1
5. **Implementation complete** → Run tests, celebrate, ask "What's next?"

**DO NOT** wait for user input. Start working immediately based on the stage.
