## 📝 Description

Rotki is an open-source, self-hosted portfolio management tool that puts privacy first.

The application provides comprehensive portfolio tracking across multiple blockchains and exchanges, transaction decoding, analytics, accounting, and tax reporting capabilities. It supports 80+ DeFi protocols and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
