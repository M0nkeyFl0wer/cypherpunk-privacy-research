  ARPA Network is a decentralized secure computation network built to improve the fairness,
  security, and privacy of blockchains. Originally founded in 2018 as ARPA Chain (privacy-preserving
  MPC network), it rebranded as ARPA Network and shifted focus to Threshold BLS Signature Schemes
  (TSS-BLS), a specialized subset of MPC. The network's threshold BLS signature infrastructure
  serves verifiable Random Number Generation (RNG), secure wallets, cross-chain bridges, and
  decentralized custody across multiple blockchains.
