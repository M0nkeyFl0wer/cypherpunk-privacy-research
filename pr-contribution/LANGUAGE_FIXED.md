# Language Corrections Complete ✅

All "our/we/your" language has been corrected to properly reflect:

**"My/I"** = Your individual research work  
**"The Web3Privacy Explorer/database/existing database"** = The Web3Privacy Now project

## Key Changes Made:

1. ✅ "We've been" → "As a long-time contributor to Web3Privacy Now, I've been"
2. ✅ "Our dataset" → "My research dataset"
3. ✅ "Your database" → "The Web3Privacy Explorer database"
4. ✅ "We can enrich" → "I can enrich"
5. ✅ "Our detailed data" → "My detailed research"
6. ✅ "Your existing projects" → "The existing Web3Privacy database"
7. ✅ "We're taking" → "I'm taking"
8. ✅ "Our commitment" → "My commitment"
9. ✅ "We document" → "I document"
10. ✅ "Ready for us to submit" → "Ready for me to submit"

## Positioning:

The forum post now correctly positions you as:
- A long-time contributor to Web3Privacy Now
- Someone offering individual research to enhance the shared database
- Collaborative (not claiming ownership of Web3Privacy's work)
- Professional and humble

## Ready to Post!

The language is now appropriate for posting to the Web3Privacy community.
