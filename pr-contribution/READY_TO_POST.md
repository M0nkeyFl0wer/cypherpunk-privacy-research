## 💬 Expected Questions & Your Responses

### "How do you verify team data?"

> "We cross-reference LinkedIn profiles, GitHub accounts, official websites, and Twitter. Each team member gets a confidence score based on verification strength. For example, a founder mentioned on company website + LinkedIn + GitHub = 0.95 confidence."

### "What's your update cadence?"

> "Quarterly updates for all contributed projects, with ad-hoc updates for major events (new audits, funding rounds, team changes). We'll maintain a public changelog."

### "How do you handle project shutdowns?"

> "Our validation pipeline flags deprecated/inactive projects. We update status transparently and add sunset dates. We don't remove historical data - just mark status clearly."

### "Will you maintain this long-term?"

> "Yes - we're committing to ongoing maintenance. We see this as continuous community contribution, not a one-time data dump. We're in for the long haul."

### "What if we disagree on data?"

> "Your project, your rules! If maintainers disagree with our research, we'll defer to official sources or remove disputed data. Collaboration > being right."

## 🎨 Example Discord Opening (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
Hey Web3Privacy community! 👋

I've been conducting deep research on Web3 privacy projects using a constitutional research methodology (multi-source verification, confidence scoring, gap reporting).

**What we have:**
- 117 projects with rigorous research
- Code reviews, OPSEC assessments, OSS Observatory metrics
- Team verification, funding data, audit reports
- 8-12 privacy techniques per project (vs typical 1-2)

**Overlap with your database:**
- 37 projects in both → we could enrich with 6-10x more data
- 80 projects only in ours → new additions
- All with confidence scores & source attribution

**Examples of our work:**
- Aztec Network: 50KB code review + OPSEC + blockchain metrics
- Tornado Cash: Comprehensive OPSEC vulnerability assessment
- 0xbow: 31KB detailed code analysis

I've written a detailed proposal explaining our methodology and contribution plan. Would love your feedback on whether this adds value to the ecosystem!
