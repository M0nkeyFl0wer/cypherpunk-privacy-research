## Organizational Structure

### Decentralized Governance

3. **Treasury Management**: DAO controls treasury receiving 0.25% protocol fees
4. **Active Governors**: Stakers participating in governance receive rewards

### Governance Mechanics

- **Voting Power**: 1 RAIL = 1 vote (must be staked)
- **Stake Lock Time**: 30 days
- **Snapshot Interval**: 1 day
- **Active Governor Rewards 2024**: Over $1.9 million distributed

## Key Supporters

### Ethereum Foundation (2025)

In June 2025, the Ethereum Foundation publicly supported RAILGUN by:
- Staking 50,000 RAIL tokens
- Integrating RAILGUN into Kohaku privacy wallet toolkit (October 2025)

This endorsement from the Ethereum Foundation significantly boosted RAILGUN's credibility, causing a 300% token price surge.

### Vitalik Buterin

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has publicly praised RAILGUN's compliance approach, calling the zkLend blocking "a solid demonstration of compliant privacy in practice."

*Constitutional Research Note: RAILGUN's pseudonymous founding and decentralized structure make traditional team verification challenging. The use of a literary pseudonym (Emmanuel Goldstein from 1984) suggests intentional privacy-preservation aligned with the project's mission. While this limits verifiability, it is consistent with cypherpunk values.*
