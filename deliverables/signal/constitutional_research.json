  "description": "Signal is an open-source, cross-platform encrypted messaging application developed by the Signal Technology Foundation. It pioneered the Signal Protocol, which provides end-to-end encryption with forward secrecy and post-compromise security. The protocol has been adopted by WhatsApp, Google Messages, Facebook Messenger, and Skype. As of 2025, Signal has approximately 70 million monthly active users.",
