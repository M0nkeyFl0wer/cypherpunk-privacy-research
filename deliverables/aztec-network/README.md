# Aztec Network - Programmable Privacy

## Overview

**Project Status:** Active (Public Testnet)
**Category:** DeFi
**Ecosystem:** Ethereum Layer 2
**Description:** Privacy-first ZK rollup

Aztec Network is a privacy-focused Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that enables encrypted transactions and confidential smart contracts through advanced zero-knowledge proof technology. The project implements a ZK-ZK Rollup (ZK²) architecture, combining the scalability benefits of rollups with comprehensive privacy guarantees.

**Launch Status:** Public Testnet, Mainnet planned Q4 2025

**Historical Note:** Aztec Connect was previously on mainnet (deployed at `0xff1f2b4adb9df6fc8eafecdcbf96a2b351680455`) but has been deprecated in favor of the current Aztec Network architecture.

## Privacy Techniques

Aztec Network implements 10 advanced privacy-preserving technologies:

1. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-SNARKs)** - Cryptographic proofs that enable transaction verification without revealing sensitive data
2. **PLONK Proof System** - Efficient universal zero-knowledge proof system with polynomial commitment schemes
3. **ZK-ZK Rollup (ZK²)** - Novel architecture combining ZK rollup scalability with ZK-based privacy
4. **Encrypted Transactions** - End-to-end encryption of transaction data
5. **Private State Management** - Confidential state storage and retrieval mechanisms
6. **Nullifier System** - Prevents double-spending while maintaining privacy
7. **Private Execution Environment (PXE)** - Secure environment for executing private smart contract logic
8. **Note Encryption** - Encrypted UTXO-style notes for private value transfer
9. **Hybrid Public-Private Execution** - Support for both transparent and confidential operations
10. **Confidential Smart Contracts** - Programmable privacy-preserving applications
