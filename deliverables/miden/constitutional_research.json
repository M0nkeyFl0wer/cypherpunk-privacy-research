  "description": "Miden is a STARK-based zero-knowledge virtual machine and Ethereum L2 rollup that prioritizes privacy, client-side proving, and high throughput. It uses an Actor model where each account operates independently, generating its own proofs. The project was originally incubated by Polygon Labs and became independent (0xMiden) in March 2025 after raising $25M from a16z crypto, 1kx, and Hack VC.",
