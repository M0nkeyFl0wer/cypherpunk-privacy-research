# Tor Project

## Description
The Tor Project is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that maintains the Tor anonymity network and associated software. Tor (The Onion Router) enables anonymous communication by routing traffic through a worldwide volunteer network of relays using onion routing. Originally developed for the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, it became the foundation of anonymous internet access used by journalists, activists, and privacy-conscious individuals worldwide.
