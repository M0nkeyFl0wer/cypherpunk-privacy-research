# Briar

## Description
Briar is a peer-to-peer encrypted messenger designed for activists, journalists, and anyone needing censorship-resistant communication. Unlike traditional messengers, Briar can sync messages directly via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or Tor - functioning even during internet shutdowns. Founded in 2011 by Michael Rogers with security consultant Eleanor Saitta, it has passed two independent security audits.
