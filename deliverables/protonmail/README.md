# Proton Mail

## Description
Proton Mail is a Swiss end-to-end encrypted email service founded in 2014 by scientists from CERN and MIT. Operated by Proton AG (owned by the non-profit Proton Foundation), it provides zero-access encryption meaning even Proton cannot read user emails. As of 2022, Proton Mail had nearly 70 million users worldwide.

Proton has expanded into a full privacy suite including Proton VPN, Proton Drive, Proton Calendar, Proton Pass, and Proton Wallet - all using end-to-end encryption with open-source clients.
