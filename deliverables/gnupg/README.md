# GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard)

## Description
GnuPG is a free implementation of the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880) for encrypting and signing data. Created by Werner Koch in 1999 after being inspired by Richard Stallman, it serves as the open-source replacement for the proprietary PGP. GnuPG was used by Edward Snowden to evade NSA monitoring and is critical infrastructure for secure communications worldwide. German government BSI-certified for classified document handling.
